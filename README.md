# Code demo source code for Dom Code meetup July 2019

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing and running

Install the dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`:

```
npm install

//or

yarn
```

Start the application:

```

```

The application will start on `localhost:3000` or the first available port thereafter if `3000` is in use.
